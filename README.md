# Aim-Trainer
### (Under Development)

Making a aim trainer using Javascript(vanilla) and Html.

### How It Works

So there is a canvas in which everything happens. 
The web application continuosly draws circle of random size at random coordinates.
When a player clicks with the mouse the script calculates the distance between the click position and the circle's center.
If the distance is less than circle's radius then it is a hit but if it is more than the radius then it is a miss.

Scores are rewarded as per the number of target hit by the player.
5 - Normal hit          10 - Critical hit(in the center)

The color of the circle which change as follow:

Blue : Normal

Yellow : Miss

Orange : Normal Hit

Red : Critical Hit
