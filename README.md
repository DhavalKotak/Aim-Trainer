# Aim-Trainer
### (Under Development)

Making a aim trainer using Javascript(vanilla) and Html.

### How It Works

So there is a canvas in which everything happens. 
The web application continuosly draws circle of random size at random coordinates.
When a user click with the mouse the script calculates the distance between the click position and the circle's center.
If the distance is less than circle's radius then it is a hit but if it is more than the radius then it is a miss.
